Note, that you have to make the\n  .drush folder yourself (so you end up with ~/.drush/entity_scaffodler/README.md).\n- In a folder specified with the include option (see above).\n- In /path/to/drush/commands (not a Smart Thing, but it would work).\n\n\n\n\nScaffold File Layout\n\n\nYour scaffolder source files should be written as regular yaml files, and placed in a directory somewhere in your project. Normally this directory will be named under \n.tools/es\n and will exist at the top level of your project.\n\n\nThe typical project you can create will look something like this:\n\n\n.tools/es/\n    config.yaml\n    fpp/\n        gallery.yaml\n        copy.yaml\n        intro.yaml\n        video.yaml\n        multimedia.yaml\n    paragraphs/\n        video.yaml\n        text.yaml\n        headline.yaml\n    breakpoint_groups/\n        Frontend.yaml\n    image_style/\n        article_image_portrait.yaml\n        article_image.yaml\n        card-related.yaml\n    picture/\n        article-image-portrait.yaml\n        article-image.yaml\n        card-related.yaml\n\n\n\n\nRunning EntityScaffolder\n\n\nUse EntityScaffolder as drush plugin\n\n\n$ cd \nyour-drupal-root-folder\n\n$ drush es\n\n\n\n\nThis will read cofniguration files from \n_tool/es\n directory under \nyour-drupal-root-folder\n.",
