It is used to create Entities and Fields quickly and conviniently for a Drupal project.\n\n\nThe EntityScaffolder makes use of the Drush and other third party components which allows you to automatically generate much of code required to create some entities and fields. In addition, EntityScaffolder also provides some helper functions to support theming integration with patternlab based frontend.\n\n\nSome common tasks are:\n\n\n\n\nCreate Entites\n\n\nFildable Panels Pane\n\n\nParagraphs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttach fields to created entities\n\n\nText\n\n\nLong Text\n\n\nFile\n\n\nImage\n\n\nParagraph\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate placeholder Drupal Templates\n\n\nAdd some preprocessing to the templates to provide sensible defaults to work with\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nEntity Scaffolder depends on drush (the \nDRU\npal \nSH\nell). To use entity_scaffodler, you have to first download and install drush from \ndrush\n. Install instructions can be found at Drush's \nREADME.txt\n. It contains\na section about installing other commands like drush_make.\n\n\nHere is the relevant section.\n\n\nYou can put this folder in a number of places:\n\n- In a .drush folder in your HOME folder. Note, that you have to make the\n  .drush folder yourself (so you end up with ~/.drush/entity_scaffodler/README.md).\n- In a folder specified with the include option (see above).\n- In /path/to/drush/commands (not a Smart Thing, but it would work).\n\n\n\n\nScaffold File Layout\n\n\nYour scaffolder source files should be written as regular yaml files, and placed in a directory somewhere in your project. Normally this directory will be named under \n_tools/es\n and will exist at the top level of your project.\n\n\nThe typical project you can create will look something like this:\n\n\n_tools/es/\n    config.yaml\n    fpp/\n        gallery.yaml\n        copy.yaml\n        intro.yaml\n        video.yaml\n        multimedia.yaml\n    paragraphs/\n        video.yaml\n        text.yaml\n        headline.yaml\n\n\n\n\nRunning EntityScaffolder\n\n\nUse EntityScaffolder as drush plugin\n\n\n$ cd \nyour-drupal-root-folder\n\n$ drush es\n\n\n\n\nThis will read cofniguration files from \n_tool/es\n directory under \nyour-drupal-root-folder\n.",
